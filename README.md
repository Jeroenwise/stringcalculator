# Solution of the String Calculator TDD Kata

This is the resulting code of my solution of the String Calculator TDD kata.

You can find the instruction of the kata I did on http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/

To run the tests, first install dependencies by running `composer install`. Then
run `./vendor/bin/phpunit ./src/` to actually run the tests.
